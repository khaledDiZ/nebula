//! The LAUNCHER VIEW (Settings → Experimental, `launcher_view`): nebula
//! built around the prompt instead of the tree. It opens on the QUICK
//! PROMPT, already focused, on the launch the AGENTS TAB defaults describe
//! — `^P` picks the PROJECT with type-ahead over every one this machine
//! knows, `^O` the MODEL, `Tab` the harness, `^N` flips between a fresh
//! worktree and the project's checkout — and once something has been sent
//! the three panels are gone: a GRID of cards, one per session in the
//! project on screen, most recent first, each card the session's name with the
//! worktree under it and its pull request under that, and the session
//! under the cursor live in the PANE along the BOTTOM ([`split`]). Walking
//! the cards walks the pane, so stepping through the grid reads each
//! session's progress in turn.
//!
//! Nothing here is a second copy of the tree: the list's cursor IS the
//! panels' selection (`App::selected_session`), moved through the same
//! jump the `/` PALETTE uses, so every verb that reads the selection —
//! archive, delete, rename, the diff, the context menu — keeps working on
//! the row under the cursor. What lives here is what the view adds: the
//! rows ([`rows`]), where a launch from the box lands ([`target_for`]) and
//! the PROJECT PICKER behind `^P` ([`ProjectPicker`]). The keys are
//! `event_loop::launcher`'s and the drawing `ui::launcher_view`'s.
