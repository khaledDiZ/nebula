//! Rebindable application hotkeys.
//!
//! Every key the panels react to is an [`Action`] here, with a default
//! chord list. The Hotkeys tab of the settings overlay writes overrides
//! into the shared config JSON (`keybindings: { "<action id>": "j, down" }`),
//! and the event loop dispatches through [`Keymap::lookup`] instead of
//! matching raw `KeyCode`s.
//!
//! Two things this module knows that a naive keymap wouldn't:
//!
//! * **Normalization.** Terminals disagree about how a key arrives —
//!   `Shift+j` may come through as `Char('J')` with or without the shift
//!   bit, `Ctrl+]` is spelled `Ctrl+5` in the legacy encoding, `BackTab`
//!   is really `Shift+Tab`. [`KeyChord::from_event`] folds all of that into
//!   one canonical form so a binding matches whatever the emulator sends.
//!
//! * **Host reachability.** nebula runs *inside* Terminal.app / Ghostty /
//!   tmux, which eat chords before we ever see them — every `⌘` combo, most
//!   `^⇧` ones, `^←`. [`host_warning`] flags those at bind time so the user
//!   finds out at the moment of choosing, not the next time the key does
//!   nothing.
